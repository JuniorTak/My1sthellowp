## Intro
This is an intro repo to the WP plugin development world. It allows users to add shortcodes to posts or pages for displaying a custom Google Map.
## How it works
- Open a post or page in the editor
- Add the shortcode block
- Add the following in the shortcode block: [googlemap src="***Your_GoogleMap_URL***"]
- Click to 'Publish' or 'Update'

 **Note**: ***Your_GoogleMap_URL*** would be any custom Google Map URL
